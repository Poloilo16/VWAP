VWAP Strategy Definition
========================

Strategy Overview:
- Enter a long position if the 9:31am candle's close is above VWAP
- Enter a short position if the 9:31am candle's close is below VWAP
- VWAP is calculated as the value weighted average price
- VWAP is recalculated every minute during regular market hours (9:30–16:00 ET)
- Use 100% of account equity for each trade (no leverage)

Entry Rules:
- Only enter positions based on 9:31am candle close vs VWAP
- Long: 9:31am close > VWAP
- Short: 9:31am close < VWAP

Stop Loss Rules:
- For longs: exit if any future candle closes below VWAP
- For shorts: exit if any future candle closes above VWAP

Exit Rules:
- Stop loss as defined above
- Exit all remaining positions at market close (4:00pm ET)

Position Grouping for Imbalance Analysis:
- Classify every 1-minute candle as:
  * Above VWAP if the previous candle's close > VWAP
  * Below VWAP if the previous candle's close < VWAP
- Use this to assess trend bias and market imbalance

VWAP Calculation:
VWAP = Σ(Price × Volume) / Σ(Volume)
Where:
- Price = Typical Price = (High + Low + Close) / 3
- Calculation is cumulative from market open (9:30am) each day
- Resets daily at market open
